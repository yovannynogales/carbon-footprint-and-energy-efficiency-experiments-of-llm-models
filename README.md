# carbon-footprint-and-energy-efficiency-experiments-of-llm-models
This project contains experiments with open-source LLM models to evaluate their carbon footprint and energy efficiency through code experiments, and it is open so that anyone can use them, as well as serving as an example of alternatives to proprietary models like GPT, Claude, etc.
